Emoji Battleships is a simple command-line game where players take turns trying to sink each other's ships on a 5x5 grid. The game is played against a computer opponent. The objective is to sink all of the computer's ships before the computer sinks all of your ships.

This is a game that you will want to play over and over again. Battleships is all about of strategy, memory and logic. It's a great game for enhancing your concentration, training your motor skills and improving of your strategic thinking. Everyone from children to adults can play. For the little ones it can sharpen their mind and for the grown ups, you can have pleasant, fun moments, while they can recall their childhood in the meantime.
